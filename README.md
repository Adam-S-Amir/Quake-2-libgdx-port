# quake2-libgdx-port

This is work in progres, *no platforms is fully working yet*.

Status: 

 - 2016-06-10: Desktop file donwload, extraction and conversion seems to work.


Demo (still playn code): http://quake2playn.appspot.com/ 

- If you visit the demo with `https:`, you'll need to change the download link in the input field from `http:` to `https:`, too, as pointed out in issue #1. Ill fix this when I get a chance.
