# quake2-libgdx-port

(currently just a plain fork of the playn port)

Demo: http://quake2playn.appspot.com/ 

- If you visit the demo with `https:`, you'll need to change the download link in the input field from `http:` to `https:`, too, as pointed out in issue #1. Ill fix this when I get a chance.
